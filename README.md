# Intensify! the browser extension!
Right-click an image, and click intensify to open the intensifier in a new tab.

## Bugs
* [temp fix] When reusing the tab, the tabs shows up before the image gets loaded, so it doesn't show the new image...

## Would be nice to have
* a better temp fix (look into Promises?)
* a set of icons
* a prettier page
