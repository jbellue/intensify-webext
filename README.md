# Intensify! the browser extension!

Right-click an image, and click intensify to open the intensifier in a new tab.

## What works for now
* The settings page
* Reusing the same tab

## What doesn't work
* Everything else
* The right-click. For now, it's a button on the menu tab

## Would be nice to have
* a licence
* the licence for the libraries that will be used
* a set of icons
