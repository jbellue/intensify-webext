## Bugs

* Probably loads

## Needs done

* A prettier page
* Less code duplication (I'm looking at you, options page). Maybe inject everything with JS?
* Unittests (look into [webextensions-jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webextensions-jsdom))

## Would be nice to have

* a set of icons
* an advanced options page, where the moving arrays could be defined
